# PRGChess

This repo contains a finished project to "Computer graphics" course at

Brno University
Of Technology - Faculty Of InformationTechnology.

This project is a simple scene renderer that visualizes a chessboard made up of Constructive Solid Geometry models using SDF primitives.

Scene is loaded from resources/scene.json file.

The rendering process uses a screen quad and a per-pixel raymarching algorithm in the fragment shader, utilizing techniques inspired by the informative blog of Inigo Quilez:
